# A-Redesign of my school website

In this exercise, I redesign the website for the School of Arts and Sciences: one of Washington University's schools. 


My goal is to improve the usability, content, and design of the site to make the school more attractive to potential students, and more useful for current students by considering the following objectives:


* Audience my site is trying to reach.
* Actions I want users to take while browsing the site, and make them easily accessible. This is accomplished by creating "call to action" links on your page that are easy to find.
* Information that I want users to return to the site in the future to find, such as news and announcements, a calendar of events, class schedules, etc. This information must be easy to find on the site layout and navigation.

* Text content and images on the site. Text content should be well written and informative, and images must  be appropriate and engaging.
* A polished, professional, and appropriate style for the school. The design must be good enough that it can replace the real site!
